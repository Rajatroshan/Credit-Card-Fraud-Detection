## 🔍 Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant financial issue. This project uses supervised learning algorithms to build a model that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. It includes handling imbalanced data and evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.

---

## ✅ Features

- Data preprocessing and normalization  
- Handling of imbalanced classes (using SMOTE or undersampling)  
- Implementation of various ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
- Performance evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC)  
- Interactive prediction dashboard using Streamlit  

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- XGBoost  
- Streamlit (for UI)  

---

## 📊 Dataset

- [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
